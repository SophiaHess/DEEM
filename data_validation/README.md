# Data Valdiation Process

Data validation procedures ensure that data is free from error, bias and misinterpretation. The selection of process steps in this script can be extended by your needs.

The validation process includes one script:
**data_validation.py**
The script works with csv input and output.

**The script provided is mainly focusing on data cross-validation:** 
1) address, geographical location
2) website
3) maturity
4) status
5) founding year
6) description

**CAUTION:**
Duplicate checks are dependent on the database used and can individually be set up. The same applies to data harmonization procedures. Be aware that data validation is done semi-automated and will also require manual checks of the data.
